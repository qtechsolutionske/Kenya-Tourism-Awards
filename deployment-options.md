## Recommended Path Forward

I recommend **Option 1** - keeping your React frontend and adding a proper Node.js backend with Supabase for the database. This maintains your excellent UI while adding real functionality.

Would you like me to:
1. Add a proper backend to your React app?
2. Convert everything to PHP for XAMPP?
3. Prepare static deployment files?

Please let me know your preference and I'll provide the complete implementation.
