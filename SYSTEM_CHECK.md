# Kenya Tourism Awards - System Check Report

## Current System Analysis

### Project Type
- **Technology Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Architecture**: Single Page Application (SPA)
- **Database**: Currently using mock data (no backend database)
- **Authentication**: Frontend-only mock authentication
- **Deployment**: Static site deployment (not XAMPP/PHP)

### Core Functionalities Status

#### ✅ Working Components
1. **Authentication System**
   - Login/Signup forms functional
   - Role-based access control (superadmin, admin, jury, voter, nominee)
   - Mock user authentication working

2. **Dashboard System**
   - Multi-role dashboards functional
   - Role-specific navigation and content
   - Statistics and metrics display

3. **Public Pages**
   - Homepage with hero section
   - About, Nominees, Winners, Gallery, Contact pages
   - Responsive design across all pages

4. **Admin Features**
   - System controls and phase management
   - User management interface
   - Content management system
   - Branding settings with customization

5. **Jury Portal**
   - Nomination evaluation interface
   - Scoring system with criteria
   - Progress tracking

6. **Voting System**
   - Public voting interface
   - Vote history tracking
   - Category filtering

7. **Team Management**
   - Team directory with profiles
   - Messaging system
   - Analytics and performance tracking

#### ⚠️ Current Limitations
1. **No Real Backend**: All data is mock/static
2. **No Database**: No persistent data storage
3. **No Real Authentication**: Uses localStorage mock
4. **No API Endpoints**: Frontend-only implementation

### XAMPP Deployment Considerations

**Important**: Your current project is a React SPA, not a PHP application. XAMPP is designed for PHP/MySQL applications. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Static Site Deployment
Deploy the React build as static files (recommended for current structure)

#### Option 2: Convert to PHP System
Rebuild the backend components in PHP for XAMPP compatibility

## Recommendations

### For Current React Project
1. Deploy to static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
2. Add a proper backend API (Node.js, Laravel, etc.)
3. Implement real database integration

### For XAMPP Deployment
1. Convert authentication to PHP sessions
2. Rebuild API endpoints in PHP
3. Convert React components to PHP templates
4. Set up MySQL database structure

## Next Steps Required

Please specify:
1. Do you want to keep the React frontend and add a proper backend?
2. Do you want to convert everything to PHP for XAMPP?
3. Do you want to deploy the current React app as a static site?

Based on your choice, I can provide the appropriate deployment package and database scripts.
